That can be hard to do, so in case the error is reproducible, then just launch Minecraft again, reproduce it, and send the log file.\n\n**Don't send screenshot(s)** of launcher's error popup, launcher's log window or opened log file in `Notepad.exe`, **it won't help** and will waste everyone's time!",
